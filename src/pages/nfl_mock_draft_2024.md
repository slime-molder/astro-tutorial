## Trades

* Minnesota Vikings 1.5 / Los Angeles Chargers 1.11, 1.23
	* I suspect New England and Arizona's asking prices are too high for the Vikings, so they wait until pick 5 to do business. Provided McCarthy is still on the board, it's hard to imagine a scenario where they don't trade up. 
* Chicago Bears 1.8 / Atlanta Falcons 1.9, 3.75
	* I feel very strongly that the Falcons will deal the 8th pick to somebody, although it's hard to say who. The Jets, Chargers, Jaguars, and maybe even some other surprise teams are in the conversation. Odunze is too juicy of a carrot for someone not to move up. Ultimately I went with the Bears. Even though they lack draft capital, I believe the Bears are willing to part with a 3rd rounder to set up their rookie QB as well as they can.
* Buffalo Bills 1.16 / Seattle Seahawks 1.28, 2.60
	* The Bills get their ideal WR. Brian Thomas's size and speed will be put to full use with Josh Allen. The only player I can maybe see the Seahawks drafting here is Graham Barton, but I think they'd rather move back and get a 2nd rounder, seeing as they currently lack one. 
* Carolina Panthers 1.29 / Detroit Lions 2.33, 4.101
	* The Panthers need a deep threat for Bryce Young, and Mitchell is the most talented one left, although he does have some question marks. The Lions don't love anyone here and move back a few spots. 
## Notes on some picks

* Atlanta Falcons (from Chicago) - Laiatu Latu, EDGE
	* Some people think Dallas Turner is the pick here because of Raheem Morris and his tendency to drop edge rushers into coverage. But at the end of the day, the Falcons need a pass rusher, not a coverage edge. Latu is the best pass rusher in the draft, at least on day one. Perhaps Turner can become that over time, but it's a projection. The Falcons are in win now mode with Kirk Cousins' signing, and they need the best guy on day 1. 
* New York Jets - Troy Fautanu, OT
	* Guys like Odunze and Bowers are very tempting for the Jets, but ultimately they need to bolster their offensive line. Their tackles are both 33 and questionable, health wise. Fautanu can start at guard and easily slide into either tackle spot if needed. His positional flexibility is exactly what the Jets need.
* Denver Broncos - Michael Penix Jr., QB
	* This is the single hardest pick to predict in the draft. Denver could trade up or down, and they could draft many different positons. No one knows for sure. What we do know is Denver has to draft a QB at some point, whether it's at this pick or elsewhere. I believe Michael Penix is the last QB worthy of a pick this high, and he has many traits that Sean Payton values in a QB. He's accurate, he can target any part of the field, he has a low pressure to sack rating, and he's smart and mentally tough. As a final note, Penix is the only QB to get a top 30 visit in Denver, for whatever that's worth. 
* Los Angeles Chargers (from Minnesota Vikings) - Nate Wiggins, CB
	* I considered AD Mitchell here, but I just feel like he's not a Harbaugh guy, with his admitted lack of effort and strangely low production, given his physical talent. Wiggins is a bit of a risk health-wise, but he has the talent to justify a pick in this range.
* Green Bay Packers - Junior Colson, LB
	* Probably the biggest reach in this mock, according to consensus boards, but I feel it makes sense. Colson is the best fit for Green Bay given his discipline and leadership. The other option at linebacker, Edgerrin Cooper, may be a bit too chaotic for what Green Bay is looking for. As for why they take Colson this early, well Seattle is sitting a few picks behind them here and there is a chance they could snag him as well. Plus Green Bay can afford to take a reach or two given their extra draft capital this year. Why not just ensure you get the best option at a big position of need?
* Kansas City Chiefs - Ricky Pearsall, WR
	* With the top 5 WRs off the board, it's not obvious who of the remaining options fits KC the best. I ultimately chose Pearsall as he's the most complete package. He's speedy, tall, has great hands, and is a good route runner. I think he could catch fire in Kansas City and look like a steal.
